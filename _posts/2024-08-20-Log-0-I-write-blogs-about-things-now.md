Welcome to my blog. I made this site purely to document what I have learned and hopefully help some more people understand things better. I am interested in various topics and will probably have some categorisation (if I have it implemented) to make it easier to look up. 

Some of the things I will be talking about will be as follows:
 1. Software Development
 2. Machine Learning
 3. Latest technology that I find interesting
 4. Random thoughts I feel worthy of sharing
 5. ..... (I don't know yet)
