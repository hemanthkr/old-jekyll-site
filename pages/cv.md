## Projects
---

- **Battery Life Cycle Prediction before Degradation** - Reproduced the results of a paper titled
‘Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation’ by implementing an
Elastic Net Regression model to study the MIT dataset which consists of 124 commercial
lithium-ion batteries cycled to failure under fast-charging conditions. The model can achieve
prediction of cycle life with less than 15% error on average.
- **Multiple Object Tracking with Vision Transformers** - Implemented Multiple Object Tracking
(MOT) using Vision Transformers by extending the self-attention architecture, leveraging the
MOT20 benchmark dataset. Demonstrated the efficacy of Vision Transformers by achieving
competitive performance close to state-of-the-art results through training with the MOT20
dataset along with supplementary data on GCP.
- **Age Estimation and Gender Classification** - Developed and fine-tuned a self-defined CNN model
on a subset of the UTKFace dataset achieving a notable mae of 6.28 for age estimation and an
impressive 98% accuracy for gender classification.
- **Lunar Lander Problem Using Reinforcement Learning** - Developed a solution for the Lunar
Landing problem using OpenAI’s gym toolkit environments, employing a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
agent. Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning over 400 episodes, resulting in the agent
achieving an optimal policy for efficient and accurate spacecraft landing.
