I am a Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in software engineering and have worked in a variety of roles, including Data Engineering, Sofware Development and Machine Learning.

I like to dive deep into topics that peak my interest and this blog will be a place to share my learnings. I was inspired from this [__blog__](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) by _Dr. Rachel Thomas_ from [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) to start documenting my learning. Here are some of my favorite parts of the blog:

> The top advice I would give my younger self would be to start blogging sooner.

> Helps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.

> You are best positioned to help people one step behind you.

I am hoping that this blog will keep me disciplined when the discomfort of learning new things becomes real. For more information on my background and experience, take a look at my [CV]({% link pages/cv.md %}).
